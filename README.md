# Hacker News Lite

A lightweight client for hacker news because there is no good free app for my phone.

This project was mainly built to understand some of the fundamental reasons why React was built. Through this project I learned about the virtual DOM, DOM diffing, and component lifecycle methods.
This was implemented in jQuery with a simple express wrapper. There are a lot of things looking back on this project that I would change but I am leaving it up as is for a good sense of where I was starting from.
